## Course goal
**This course seeks to equip you, the student, with knowledge of the causes of climate change, an appreciation for the sources of uncertainty, and the ability to better assess claims made about climate change as you go about your adult lives.**

## Course Description
This class introduces you to modern climate science.  We'll explore questions like: What does *climate* mean?  What *is* Earth's climate now?  What controls it?  What was it like in Earth's past, and why?  What is it likely to do in the future?  How do human activities influence it?  Answering them requires multiple scientific approaches including physics, meteorology, physical oceanography, hydrology, atmospheric chemistry, ocean biogeochemistry, and ecology.  

Climate science relies on incredibly complicated and powerful tools such as a satellite-based observational network and supercomputer-run climate models---but this class will emphasize simple models and conceptual understanding: how we can understand many fundamental aspects of the incredibly complex climate system on a chalkboard via remarkably elegant and simple frameworks.

## Pedagogical approach
### "Climate change" vs. "climate science"
This is a class about the physical science of *climate change*.  The science of climate change is a subset of the broader topic of *climate science*, and truly understanding many aspects of climate change requires somewhat deep dives into the underlying fundamental climate science.  However, this underlying science will always be on an as-needed basis in order to understand modern climate change.  

(Traditionally---including when I've taught it in the past---this course and ones like it taught by Earth science or similar departments have had roughly the opposite approach: teach the fundamental underlying climate science, without regard to climate change, and then bring in the climate change problem at the end.  For a long time, this made sense, when the students enrolling in these courses were mostly those preparing for future careers in scientific research on climate, and the problem of climate change was less severe physically and less predominant societally.  But times have changed.  Understandably, most of you care much more about how climate is already changing and might change in the future.)

### Integrating artificial intelligence
Now, in early 2025, we are in the midst of a revolution in the abilities and usage of artificial intelligence (AI) models, most of all, large language models (LLMs) such as [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/).

## Goals
The goal of this course is to leave you well-informed about climate change, in order to leave you well equipped moving forward in your life to evaluate claims made about climate change and ultimately make your own decisions about climate change.  

This includes two broad categories.  First: climate change that has *already happened*, starting from the early 20th century through tht present.  Second: the *projections of future* climate change in the remainder of the 21st century.  This is something like the span of generations from your  great-grandparents to your own future great grand-children.

In both cases---historical climate change and projected future climate change---there are aspects of the problem we are very confident in, and there are others that we are highly unsure of.  For the future projections, much of that uncertainty comes not from the physical science but from societal outcomes.

Broadly, we will start with the physical aspects of climate change that are most certain, and as the course progresses we will work our way to increasingly more uncertain topics.  So, we'll start with the direct effect of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere on radiative transfer, and how that acts to warm the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere including the surface.  Understanding the temperature response to climate change is doubly important, because not only is it important for its own sake, but as we'll see later so many of the other impacts of climate change approximately scale with the globally averaged temperature change. 

But in parallel with the physical science, we will explore the societal aspects of climate change.  To be clear, this *is* a class on the *physical science* of climate change, not one on climate policy, law, or other more social-scientific aspects of climate change.  However, as we will see, being able to effectively evaluate claims made about and projections of how the climate is changing and will change requires us, in 2025, to bring in these non-hard-science topics.  We'll find that these are the most uncertain of all, and in some ways are more than that, they're intrinsically unanswerable.

This certainly requires some social science: economics, political science, psychology, sociology.  But it also requires philosophy and ethics.  Questions  like, "What do we owe the unborn?"  Should we prioritize helping the greatest number of people, or helping those who most need it, or punishing those most responsible, or something else?  The answer one arrives at to these types of questions inherently involves *values*, whether we're aware of that or not, and as such these questions fall into the realm of philosophy and ethics.

Broadly speaking, you could say that regarding the physical science material, we will both ask questions and largely provide answers---even if those answers include some uncertainty.  Whereas regarding the more societal aspects, it is more about the asking of the questions themselves.

## Grading
There is no pre-set distribution of grades or "curve" across the class: you are **not** competing against your classmates.

For those enrolled in this class as EAS 48800 or SUS 7300B, this course is 3 credits.  For those enrolled in B8800, it is 4 credits, with the 4th credit coming through a term paper covered [here](../assignments/b8800-term-paper).

The grading breakdown is listed below.  Participation is determined by your attendance, attentiveness, engagement during class, and weekly posts on the course Blackboard site message board (more details on that below).  Attending class is crucial!  Lectures will not generally be recorded or zoomed, because as much as possible we'll be working at the blackboard rather than from slides.

## Expectations
### Readings
You should consider assigned reading from the textbook to be **mandatory**, as opposed to optional/supplemental.  Asssigned readings are posted on the [course schedule](./schedule), and it is expected that you have completed the assigned reading **prior to arriving at class that day**.

That said, the midterms and final exam will focus almost entirely on material we cover directly in class.  So spend your time studying accordingly.

<!-- ### Weekly posts on course message board
As part of the participation category of grading, each week (starting the week of Feb. 19-23) you are required to post at least once to the course Brightspace message board.  The post can be either one of the following:

1. Identifying something from class or from an assignment that you didn't fully understand.
2. Providing an answer or explanation to somebody else's post about something they didn't fully understand. -->

### Homework
HW assignments are graded on an *effort* basis, A+ through F.  An earnest, thoughtful attempt at every problem will earn you an A.  Truly exceptional work will earn an A+.

All HW due dates will be posted on the [course schedule](./schedule).  **They are due at the START of class, 9:30am, that day.**

At the end of the semester, your lowest HW score will be dropped.

### Discussion of politically controversial topics
Climate change has become a deeply political topic, and we will not shy away from the resulting controversies.

Borrowing [from](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/inspiring-minds/embrace-dont-avoid-morally-controversial-topics-in-class?utm_medium=email&utm_source=bulletin&utm_campaign=240528) [others](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/teaching-heterodoxy-syllabus-language/), here are guidelines for this approach:

- Bring light, not heat.
- Treat every member of the class with respect, even if you disagree with their opinion.
- Respecting others’ opinions doesn’t mean giving up your own.
- No ideas are immune from scrutiny and debate.
- That includes those stated by your professor!

The instructor will *not* advocate for or against any particular societal response to climate change, whether political, economic, technological, philosophical, or anything else.  Students will of course have the right to do so, whatever their positions.  That said, demographically at CCNY in Spring 2025 in a class on Climate Change that each of you enrolled in as an elective, it is extremely likely that a considerable majority of you hold a fairly progressive outlook regarding climate change.  As a result, the instructor will deliberately emphasize arguments that challenge that perspective, meaning those that are more market-oriented and wary of tradeoffs as regards overall human flourishing in the context of climate change and emissions reductions.  *This does not constitute the course advocating for any particular ideological stance.*  If it was likely or empirically determined that the class makeup was in fact predominantly right-leaning as regards climate change, the instructor would take the exact opposite tack, emphasizing arguments coming from a more progressive/activist bent.  *The goal is for the semester to end without you having any good idea of what the instructor's own actual beliefs are about these issues.*

You are encouraged to play the part of the “devil’s advocate,” even for ideas that initially seem obvious.  You can even do this explicitly, by saying to the instructor or a classmate, “I’m playing devil’s advocate here, but what if someone thought X instead?”  You will never be penalized for disagreeing with or questioning something the instructor classmate says, as long as it is done respectfully.

## Academic Integrity
I encourage you to use ChatGPT **as a tool to advance your learning, not as a crutch**.  You simply will not learn the material if you uncritically ask ChatGPT to do your assignments for you---and your exam scores will reflect that.  But it is possible to use in a way that helps you really understand the material.  More generally: don't cheat.  You are required to follow CCNY's [Community Standards](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/community-standards) and the [CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy/).
