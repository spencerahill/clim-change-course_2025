<h2>Overview: data analysis project on a climate dynamics topic of your choice<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-data-analysis-project-on-a-climate-dynamics-topic-of-your-choice" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In a paper and accompanying in-class presentation focusing on some topic within the broad umbrella of climate science, you will access a dataset, perform some analyses on that dataset, read some relevant peer-reviewed articles, and synthesize your findings from your reading and your data analysis.</p>
<!-- In a paper and accompanying in-class presentation, you will summarize the state of understanding of some topic within the broad umbrella of climate science, based on a close reading of at least ten published peer-reviewed scientific articles on that topic. -->
<p>The topic needs to be (at least predominantly) <strong>hard science</strong> as opposed to, say, climate policy, climate justice, climate economics, etc.</p>
<!-- Motivation: one of the single most important skills in science is the ability to effectively synthesize the contents of many technical articles into a coherent picture of what is understood and what remains open regarding the given topic.  (In fact, that's probably true of most *knowledge professions*, including law, medicine, and engineering as well.) 

A *literature review*, wherein you read widely on the topic and then synthesize your findings into your own written summary, is a great way to do that.  It forces you to read widely about the topic and, in developing your thoughts on that reading into written prose, organizing and tightening your understanding. -->
<p>This should be about something that <em>you</em> particularly want to learn more about.  That said, for inspiration some example potential topics are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Polar-amplified warming</p></li>
<li><p>Climate sensitivity vs. Earth-system sensitivity</p></li>
<li><p>The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and climate</p></li>
<li><p>How has the Montreal Protocol influenced global temperatures?</p></li>
<li><p>How do aerosols influence deep convective clouds?</p></li>
<li><p>Physically, how would Solar Radiation Management geoengineering work?</p></li>
<li><p>Role of land-use and land-cover change in climate change</p></li>
<li><p>Atmospheric circulations on other terrestrial planets</p></li>
<li><p>How ocean biological processes are incorporated into climate models</p></li>

<p>The final submitted paper should be ~10-15 double-spaced pages, including figures and the bibliography.</p>
<!-- The final submitted paper will be ~4000-5000 words, which should be ~10-15 double-spaced pages, including figures, but not including the bibliography. -->
<p>The abstract should not exceed roughly 250 words.  The abstract should introduce the scientific question you’re exploring, motivate it, and briefly summarize the paper’s key findings, and possibly conclude with some outlook for future work etc.  No more, no less.</p>
<p>The 10-15 page range is only a guideline: more important than the exact length is how clearly you convey your scientific story.  If you can do that in, say, 8 pages, that’s great.  (As the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.quora.com/Who-wrote-the-quote-If-I-had-more-time-I-would-have-written-you-a-shorter-letter">adage</a> goes, “Sorry I wrote you a long [term paper]; I didn’t have time to write you a shorter one.”)</p>
<p>Or, especially if you include multiple large figures, perhaps you’ll end up needing, say, 18 pages.</p>

<p>What is a “nontrivial factual claim?”  A useful rule of thumb is the following: would a typical adult be able to find the information <em>and understand it</em> via a few minutes of Googling?  If yes, it doesn’t need a citation.  So, for example, the radius of Earth does not require a citation.  But if not, it does require a citation.  So, for example, the role Earth’s radius plays in the atmospheric angular momentum distribution would require one or more citations.</p>
<p>When in doubt, include a citation—much better to add a citation that could have been done without than to leave out a citation that really should have been there.  This is because omitting needed citations can give the impression of academic disintegrity, which is very serious indeed.  By comparison, excess citations are just moderately distracting/grating for the reader.</p>
<p>You must include a bibliography after the main text, comprising <em>every</em> paper that is cited in the main text <em>and no others</em>.</p>
<p>There is no particular required formatting style—MLM, APA, etc.—for the in-line citations or bibliography.  Pick one, use it consistently, and follow the same two rules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The bibliography entries must be <em>complete</em>, meaning they include each of the following: article title, publication, volume, issue, page numbers, DOI, and publication year or date.  E.g. “Jane Doe, “Numerical investigation of XYZ.”  <em>Journal of ABC</em>, Volume 32, Issue 1, 1023-1033.  doi:10.1077/jabc-123.”</p></li>
<li><p>The in-line citations should include the last name(s) of the author(s) and the year of publication, e.g. “Doe 2019”, “Lopez and Doe 1994”, or, if there are more than two authors, ``Lopez et al 1959’’.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The bibliography entries of the final submitted paper should not include the annotations you generated earlier on in the semester.</p>

<section id="figures-and-tables">
<h3>Figures and tables<a class="headerlink" href="#figures-and-tables" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the figures you generate yourself, you are welcome to include figures or tables taken from the papers you cite.  Simply include in the figure caption language along the lines of “Reproduction of Fig.~X from Martinez et al. 2020.”  Likewise for tables.</p>
<p>Every included figure or table should be numbered, captioned, and explicitly referenced in the text at least once, even if the reference is as brief as “…blah blah (Figure 1)”.</p>

<section id="formatting">
<h3>Formatting<a class="headerlink" href="#formatting" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In addition to being double-spaced, keep all other formatting (font, margins, etc.) standard-ish.  I’d rather have it go to e.g. a 16th page with ample margins and a 11 or 12-pt font rather than it being squished into 15 pages.</p>

<h3>Precision and concreteness<a class="headerlink" href="#precision-and-concreteness" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>As much as possible, avoid generic statements like “X influences Y”, where “influence” could alternatively be “effects”, “modifies” “changes” etc.  Precisely how does X influence Y?  In what sign, and if possible quantitatively by how much?  Via what physical (or other) mechanism?</p>
<p>A useful rule of thumb here is: what/when/where/why/how/how much.  Each one should be answered.</p>

<p>“Puff” is a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9873666-utilize-a-noxious-puff-word-since-it-does-nothing-that-good-old">phrase I’m borrowing</a> from the late author David Foster Wallace.  It denotes words, clauses, or sometimes whole sentences that are intended to make the writing seem more important than it actually is.  From DFW himself, describing one particular puff word, <em>utilize</em> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>Utilize: A noxious puff-word.  Since it does nothing that good old <em>use</em> doesn’t do, its extra letters and syllables don’t make a writer seem smarter; rather, using utilize makes you seem either like a pompous twit or like someone so insecure that she’ll use pointlessly big words in an attempt to look sophisticated. […] What’s worth remembering about puff-words is something that good writing teachers spend a lot of time drumming into undergrads: <strong>“formal writing” does not mean gratuitously fancy writing; it means clean, clear, maximally considerate writing.</strong></p>

<p>It’s ok and even encoraged to give, as part of your Concluding section, some brief and narrowly scoped remarks regarding what you believe is important moving forward given what you learned from the papers you reviewed.  But keep it to that, and avoid absolutist language: (e.g. “we must”, “imperative”, etc.).  The job of this paper is to present some nontrivial data analysis on a given topic and put it in context of the broader state of understanding.  Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>The final presentation will be in the style of a standard talk at an academic conference within the Earth sciences.</p>
<p>Each student will present a “conference-style” oral presentation to the class summarizing their final project.  “Conference style” means that it follows the format of a standard oral presentation typical of major conferences in Earth Sciences such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.agu.org/">American Geophysical Union</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting">Fall Meeting</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ametsoc.org">American Meteorological Society</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://annual.ametsoc.org">Annual Meeting</a>.</p>

<li><p>Presentation: 10 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>Questions from the audience: 2 minutes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(The more standard conference length is 15 minutes, 12 for the talk and then 3 for Q&amp;A, but to get the whole class in we have to do a shorter style.  Also, since COVID, more conferences are doing shorter talks for various reasons.)</p>

<section id="presentation-requirements">
<h3>Presentation requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#presentation-requirements" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>You must include slides.  These can be in Powerpoint, Keynote, Google Slides, or anything else.  You will submit these and they will be evaluated on their own in addition to your actual delivery of the presentation.  Guidelines below offer recommendations, but ultimately there are no hard requirements on the actual content of your slides.</p>
<p>Instructions for how to submit your slides has been posted to the course Blackboard.</p>

<h3>Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#guidelines" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Everything in this section is meant to be helpful, but none of it is strictly required.  You can deviate from e.g. the slide template if you feel like your presentation will be better served by a different structure.</p>
</div>
<section id="presentation-scope">
<h4>Presentation scope<a class="headerlink" href="#presentation-scope" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Whereas the written report for this project is meant to be fairly exhaustive, where you document <em>all</em> the important analyses that you performed, an oral presentation has to be more targeted.  Eight minutes will fly by!  So ask yourself: if you had to pick just <em>one</em> thing that you want to convey about your project, what would it be?  Then build your talk around that.</p>
</section>
<section id="narrative">
<h4>Narrative<a class="headerlink" href="#narrative" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Human beings are storytellers.  We understand and retain things best when they are presented as a coherent <em>narrative</em>, with a beginning, middle, and end.  (Actually, we retain them best of all when they are put to music, but I won’t ask you to sing your presentation.)</p>
<p>This approach of creating a <em>narrative</em> can be contrasted with what’s unfortunately more typical in scientific presentations (and teaching writ large): a “data dump” listing one fact after the other without linking things together.</p>
<p>So before you start hacking away at slides, a useful first step is to write down the <em>thesis statement</em> of your presentation: what’s the 1 sentence summary of what you want to convey?  From there, you can craft a narrative with an intro that motivates that problem (“beginning”), a main, middle section that actually conveys it (“middle”), and an end that synthesizes the  individual things you presented (“end”) and leaves the audience wanting more.</p>

<section id="presentation-structure">

<p>A good rule of thumb is 1 minute per slide <em>on average</em> over your whole presentation.  So for a 10 minute talk (not 12!  the last 2 are for Q&amp;A), you should aim for 8-10 slides.  This suggests the following template, in the case of just 8 slides:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Title slide: who are you, what’s the overall topic you’ll be presenting</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation: what is the big-picture topic you’re addressing, and why is it important and/or interesting?  (I.e. why should we care?)</p></li>
<li><p>Introducing your project (what, in broad strokes, did <em>you</em> do to address the topic?) and talk outline (“tell the audience what you’re going to say”): <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\leq\)</span>1 sentence summary of each of your <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\leq\)</span>3 main points. (In a longer talk, these would be split into separate slides.)</p></li>
<li><p>Main point 1</p></li>
<li><p>More on main point 1</p></li>
<li><p>Main point 2</p></li>
<li><p>More on main point 2 (or maybe a 3rd main point if you have it.)</p></li>
<li><p>Recap (“tell them what you’ve said”) and Discussion (Where is this going / could this go from here?  What are the implications?)  (In a longer talk, these would be split into separate slides.)</p></li>

<section id="slides">
<h4>Slides<a class="headerlink" href="#slides" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Some guidelines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Less is more.</p></li>
<li><p>Make each slide do one thing, not multiple things.</p></li>
<li><p>Make each slide’s title a complete sentence that summarizes the main point you want the slide to convey.</p></li>
<li><p>Some text is helpful, but usually people include too much.  Boil it down to the essentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Plots: describe in words every single image and table you include.  This is for accessibility, but also because almost always audience members can’t tell as fast as you think they can what it is you’re showing.</p></li>
<li><p>Make all text, plot labels, plotted symbols, and images big enough that everyone in the room can read them.</p></li>
<li><p>Give your slides some breathing room: a slide that’s totally full with text, multiple plots, etc. is overwhelming and results in <em>less</em> information being effectively conveyed than if you had less.</p></li>
<li><p>Related, dispense with “slidejunk”: you don’t need slide numbers, logos, the date, etc. on every slide.  (Except for a logo of your institution on the title slide, you don’t even need these anywhere!)</p></li>
<li><p>If the professor’s own slides for this class fail to meet these recommendations sometimes, well, “Do as I say, not as I do” ;)</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Try not to worry!  Public speaking can be intimidating, but especially in this setting everyone, the professor and the other students, are there to support you and learn from you.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice the talk at least once ahead of time <strong>with a timer</strong>.  Make sure that you’re within the time limit.  Nobody likes a talk that goes way beyond its allotted time; it’s rude to the audience and the other presenters.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be afraid of silence.  For the audience, it’s actually a huge relief when a speaker takes a few seconds between slides or to take a sip of water.  It helps the audience take a second to gather their thoughts.</p></li>

<h3>Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<!-- #### Your presentation -->
<p>Your presentation will be graded based on the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Narrative quality: do you tell a single, coherent “scientific story” with a clear beginning, middle, and end?  Or do you try to pack in too many different things?</p></li>
<li><p>Science quality: are the arguments, calculations, and plots presented valid?  Or do they include errors or other problems?</p></li>
<li><p>Slide quality: does each slide convey a message in service of your story?  Is there enough text, plots, etc. on each slide to convey that message?  Is there <em>too</em> much on each slide for the audience to digest?  Are the fonts big enough?</p></li>
<li><p>Length: did you complete your slides within the 8 minute time limit?  Or did you go over?  (To ensure we get through them all, you’ll get 2-minute and 1-minute warnings, and at the 8 minute mark I’ll ask you to wrap up essentially right away, regardless of how far you’ve gotten.)</p></li>
<li><p>Answering questions: do you make a good-faith attempt to understand and address each question?  Do your answers cohere with what you presented?</p></li>
</ol>
<!-- #### Participation
You will be required to submit in writing one question and one piece of constructive criticism for each classmate's presentation.
* Question: what in the presentation would you like to know more about?  Or something you didn't understand that you'd like clarified?
* Constructive criticism: this could be positive---something the presenter did well.  Or, if delivered *respectfully and fairly*, something you'd recommend changing or that didn't quite land for you.

Afterwards, all students will be provided the ANONYMIZED questions and answers from their classmates.

Instructions for how to submit this feedback has been posted to the course Brightspace. -->
<!-- #### Overall grade -->
<p>Your grade will be based on a rubric nearly identical to that for the final report provided above, but using each of the five categories immediately above under “Your presentation.”</p>
