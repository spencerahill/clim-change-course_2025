    "### Left hand side equals right hand side (LHS = RHS)\n",
    "Any equation, no matter how simple or complex, must uphold that whatever is to the left of the equals sign exactly equals whatever is on the right.  If it doesn't, it's not a valid equation.  So $2+2=4$ is a valid equation, but $2+2=6$ is not.  For the latter, we could use a \"not-equals\" sign: $2+2\\neq6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algebra\n",
    "Because we can always rely on LHS=RHS, we can pretty much do whatever we want to any equation, **as long as we do the exact same thing to the left-hand side and right-hand side**.  We could add one million to both sides; we could divide by the natural logarithm of the cube root of pi; we could raise both sides to the power $x$ where $x$ is some variable; you get the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing that we can't do that matters for this class---even if we do it to both sides---is to divide by zero.  Dividing by zero is not OK, ever.  Dividing by zero will result in nonsensical results, like that $1=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demonstration (Why dividing by zero is problematic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x = 0$. Clearly,\n",
    "$$x \\cdot 1 = x \\cdot 0$$\n",
    "because zero times one is zero and also zero times zero is zero.  LHS=RHS.  So far so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now divide both sides by $x$: $$1 = 0$$\n",
    "This result, $1 = 0$, is nonsensical, demonstrating that dividing by zero is invalid.  Beware that, like in this example, dividing by zero can \"sneak in\": dividing both sides by $x$ is usually fine...but in this case $x=0$ so it's a no-no!\n",

    "### Thermodynamic systems\n",
    "A **thermodynamic system** is, quoting from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system), a \"body of matter and/or radiation separate from its surroundings that can be studied using the laws of thermodynamics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Three types of thermodynamic systems\n",
    "They are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Isolated**: no exchanges of either energy or mass with its surroundings\n",
    "2. **Closed**: no exchange of mass, but exchange of energy\n",
    "3. **Open**: exchanges of both mass and energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a nice schematic taken from the [Wikipedia page on thermodynamic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system) to illustrate these:  \n",

    ":::{admonition} Q: What type of thermodynamic system is Earth's atmosphere?  Give supporting evidence separately for the mass exchange and for the energy exchange.\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "A: With respect to energy, it exchanges energy via radiation with outer space.  So we can rule out it being an *isolated* system.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to mass, there is very little mass exchange with outer space.  But there is *plenty* of mass exchanged with the land surface and especially the ocean.  Among many other things, consider the evaporation of water from the ocean into the atmosphere, or the liquid water removed from the atmosphere and deposited into the land and ocean surfaces whenever it rains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, Earth's atmosphere is an **open thermodynamic system**.\n",

    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Q: What type of thermodynamic system is Earth's **climate system**, meaning the whole solid Earth, the oceans, and the atmosphere?  Give supporting evidence separately for the mass exchange and for the energy exchange.\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "A: As described above, there is exchange of energy via radiation with space, so it's not an *isolated* system.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to mass, while the mass exchange with outer space isn't literally zero---for example, some hydrogen atoms escape to space, and meteorites and asteroids that hit us bring mass in---the magnitudes of these mass transfers are negligible relative to the masses of the atmosphere, oceans, or solid earth.\n",

    "Therefore, on any timescale that we're interested in, Earth's climate system can be treated as a **closed thermodynamic system**.\n",

    "A **thermodynamic process** is, quoting from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_process), \"a process in which the **thermodynamic state** of a **system** is changed\" (emphases mine).\n",
    "\n",
    "What, in turn, does it mean to *change* the system's thermodynamic state?  Wikipedia again: \"a passage from an initial to a final state of **thermodynamic equilibrium**\" (emphases mine).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a classical example, consider\n",
    "\n",
    "For an atmospheric example, consider a parcel of air, and assume it doesn't mix at all with its surroundings.  It starts at one pressure, density, and temperature, and moves to another location, where it has a pressure, density, and temperature.  That process of going from the first, equilibrium state to the second, equilibrium state is a thermodynamic process.\n",

    "### The laws of thermodynamics\n",
    "#### Zeroth law of thermodynamics\n",
    "#### First law of thermodynamics\n",
    "Informally: in any thermodynamic system, energy is conserved.  It can change forms, including internal energy, heat, and work performed, but it cannot disappear into nothing or be created out of nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally: it takes different forms depending on whether the system in question is isolated, closed, or open.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important form is when it is applied to **closed thermodynamic system**s.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, formally: $$\\Delta U=Q-W$$ where\n",
    "- $\\Delta U$ is the change in **internal energy** of the system\n",
    "- $Q$ is the **heat** *added* to the system\n",
    "- $W$ is the **work** done *by* the system\n",
    "- the system is closed\n",
