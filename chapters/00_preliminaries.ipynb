    "### Left hand side equals right hand side (LHS = RHS)\n",
    "Any equation, no matter how simple or complex, must uphold that whatever is to the left of the equals sign exactly equals whatever is on the right.  If it doesn't, it's not a valid equation.  So $2+2=4$ is a valid equation, but $2+2=6$ is not.  For the latter, we could use a \"not-equals\" sign: $2+2\\neq6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algebra\n",
    "Because we can always rely on LHS=RHS, we can pretty much do whatever we want to any equation, **as long as we do the exact same thing to the left-hand side and right-hand side**.  We could add one million to both sides; we could divide by the natural logarithm of the cube root of pi; we could raise both sides to the power $x$ where $x$ is some variable; you get the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing that we can't do that matters for this class---even if we do it to both sides---is to divide by zero.  Dividing by zero is not OK, ever.  Dividing by zero will result in nonsensical results, like that $1=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demonstration (Why dividing by zero is problematic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x = 0$. Clearly,\n",
    "$$x \\cdot 1 = x \\cdot 0$$\n",
    "because zero times one is zero and also zero times zero is zero.  LHS=RHS.  So far so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now divide both sides by $x$: $$1 = 0$$\n",
    "This result, $1 = 0$, is nonsensical, demonstrating that dividing by zero is invalid.  Beware that, like in this example, dividing by zero can \"sneak in\": dividing both sides by $x$ is usually fine...but in this case $x=0$ so it's a no-no!\n",

    "### Flux\n",
    "**flux**: rate of flow of some quantity through a given surface, per unit area.  The exact physical dimensions and thus units depend on those of the quantity in consideration.  ([Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux))\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, *flux* is the formalism for the more intuitive idea of *transport*.  How much energy does the atmosphere transport from the tropics to the poles?  How much salt does the ocean transport from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific?\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuitive meanings of those questions isn't too difficult.  The way we analyze them quantitatively is via *fluxes*. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: pipe flow\n",
    "A concrete example will help.  Picture water flowing through a pipe.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The flux of *mass* of water, at any given location within the pipe, is the amount of mass of water passing through that point, per unit area, per unit time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think through the units.  Mass has units kg, area has units m$^2$, and time has units $s$, so mass per unit area per time would be $\\text{kg m}^{-2}\\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density, $\\rho$, has units $\\text{kg m}^{-3}$.  Velocity, $v$, has units $\\text{m s}^{-1}$.  So if we multiply the two, we get $\\rho v$ with units $\\text{kg m}^{-2}\\text{ s}^{-1}$, as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now we want the *total* flux of water through the pipe at the given location along the pipe's length.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we don't want it per unit area; we want to sum it over the pipe's cross-sectional area at that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would we do this---summing over all the points---in calculus?\n",
    "\n",
    "We **integrate**: $\\int_A\\rho v\\,\\mathrm{d}A$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $\\mathrm{d}A$ is the area element.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "We write it as a single integral, $\\int$, because area has physical dimensions of length squared, and we're integrating just once over all the infinitesimal area elemnts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We could just as well express that as the *double integra* over two length coordinates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So if, for example, $x$ was the left-right direction and $y$ is the up-down direction when you're looking down the length of the pipe, this would become $\\int,\\mathrm{d}A=\\dint\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}y$.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Units check: $\\int_A\\rho v\\,\\mathrm{d}A$, the meters-squared in the area element cancel those in the denominator, and so we're left with $\\text{kg s}^{-1}$ as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalizing: from pipe flow to the atmosphere\n",
    "In this case, the area that the water is flowing through is bounded by the solid walls of the pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, that's not a *requirement* of fluxes more generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, notice that even in the pipe flow example, the flux is defined locally *at each point*, including those in the interior away from the pipe walls.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the atmosphere for example, we can think about the flux of mass of air at any given point in the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our biggest concern are fluxes in the north-south direction.  The wind speed toward the north is denoted $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact same arguments apply as in the pipe flow case!  \n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\rho$ is now the density of air at each point, it follows that $\\rho v$ is the flux of air mass at any given location, with dimensions mass per unit area per unit time.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we integrate first from the surface to the top of the atmosphere, and then again in the east-west direction over a whole latitude circle, we end up with the *total flux* of mass in the north-south direction at that latitude: $$\\oint\\int\\rho v\\,\\mathrm{d}z\\mathrm{d}\\lambda$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the vertical integral is $int_0^\\infty\\,\\mathrm{d}z$: $z=0$ is the surface, and since the atmosphere doesn't really have a well defined top, we just say that we'll integrate to infinity to make sure we capture everything.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "We haven't gotten to this yet, but for our purposes here the atmosphere and ocean both are in {term}`hydrostatic balance`: $\\partial p/\\partial z=-\\rho g$.  As such, \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The east-west integral, a.k.a. *zonal* integral, is the one with the circle: $\\oint\\,\\mathrm{d}\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is longitude.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The circle is because it's a closed loop: starting at any given longitude, you move east (or west), summing up the values over all the other longitudes along the way, until you arrive back at the original longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalizing: from mass to other quantities\n",
    "So far we've been asking about the flux of *mass*.  But we can just as well think about the flux of other quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Earth's atmosphere, the three we'll be most concerned with are *energy*, *moisture*, and *angular momentum*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the mass example, we'll be most concerned with fluxes in the north-south direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, as in the mass example, our ultimate interest is the *sum total* flux of these quantities: at each latitude, summing over the whole vertical depth of the atmosphere and over all longitudes.\n",
    "\n",

    "### What is thermodynamics?\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "For our purposes, we'll always be assuming a **simple fluid**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thermodynamics (and everything else) get much more complicated in the case of fluids with chemical reactions, magnetic effects, \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thermodynamic systems\n",
    "A **thermodynamic system** is, quoting from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system), a \"body of matter and/or radiation separate from its surroundings that can be studied using the laws of thermodynamics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Three types of thermodynamic systems\n",
    "They are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Isolated**: no exchanges of either energy or mass with its surroundings\n",
    "2. **Closed**: no exchange of mass, but exchange of energy\n",
    "3. **Open**: exchanges of both mass and energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a nice schematic taken from the [Wikipedia page on thermodynamic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system) to illustrate these:  \n",

    ":::{admonition} Q: What type of thermodynamic system is Earth's atmosphere?  Give supporting evidence separately for the mass exchange and for the energy exchange.\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "A: With respect to energy, it exchanges energy via radiation with outer space.  So we can rule out it being an *isolated* system.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to mass, there is very little mass exchange with outer space.  But there is *plenty* of mass exchanged with the land surface and especially the ocean.  Among many other things, consider the evaporation of water from the ocean into the atmosphere, or the liquid water removed from the atmosphere and deposited into the land and ocean surfaces whenever it rains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, Earth's atmosphere is an **open thermodynamic system**.\n",

    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Q: What type of thermodynamic system is Earth's **climate system**, meaning the whole solid Earth, the oceans, and the atmosphere?  Give supporting evidence separately for the mass exchange and for the energy exchange.\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "A: As described above, there is exchange of energy via radiation with space, so it's not an *isolated* system.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to mass, while the mass exchange with outer space isn't literally zero---for example, some hydrogen atoms escape to space, and meteorites and asteroids that hit us bring mass in---the magnitudes of these mass transfers are negligible relative to the masses of the atmosphere, oceans, or solid earth.\n",

    "### Thermodynamic processes\n",
    "A **thermodynamic process** is, quoting from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_process), \"a process in which the **thermodynamic state** of a **system** is changed\" (emphases mine).\n",

    "For an atmospheric example, consider a parcel of air, and assume it doesn't mix at all with its surroundings.  It starts at one pressure, density, and temperature, and moves to another location, where it has a pressure, density, and temperature.  That process of going from the first, equilibrium state to the second, equilibrium state is a thermodynamic process.\n",
