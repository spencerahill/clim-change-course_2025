For example, carbon dioxide strongly absorbs radiation in a band centered at a wavelength of 15 microns.  There are several other important absorption bands coming from carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone.</p>
<p>Within the atmosphere’s absorption bands, the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-absorptivity"><span class="xref std std-term">absorptivity</span></a> is close to 1, meaning most photons get absorbed.  Outside absorption bands, absorptivity is close to zero, meaning most photons pass through the atmosphere without being absorbed.</p>

There are also <a class="reference internal" href="#term-anthropogenic"><span class="xref std std-term">anthropogenic</span></a> aerosols such as sulfate and smoke from combustion.</p>
<p>Thir precise radiative properties varies a lot across aerosol species.</p>
<p>With respect to historical emissions of aerosols by humans, overall they have slightly increased the planetary <a class="reference internal" href="#term-albedo"><span class="xref std std-term">albedo</span></a> by directly <a class="reference internal" href="#term-scattering"><span class="xref std std-term">scattering</span></a> <a class="reference internal" href="#term-shortwave-radiation"><span class="xref std std-term">shortwave radiation</span></a> back to space, which constitutes a negative <a class="reference internal" href="#term-radiative-forcing"><span class="xref std std-term">radiative forcing</span></a>.</p>
<p>They have contributed an even more negative—but highly uncertain—negative radiative forcing through their influence on cloud <a class="reference internal" href="#term-albedo"><span class="xref std std-term">albedo</span></a> via their role as cloud condensation nuclei.</p>

<dt id="term-albedo">albedo<a class="headerlink" href="#term-albedo" title="Link to this term">#</a></dt><dd><p>The fraction of the sun’s radiation that is reflected back to space.  It is a dimensionless quantity and thus unitless.  Usually denoted with a Greek lower-case alpha, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>planetary</em> albedo, meaning the global-mean, time-mean value of the albedo at the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-top-of-atmosphere"><span class="xref std std-term">top of atmosphere</span></a> is often denoted <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha_p\)</span> and for Earth’s present climate is approximately 0.3: approximately 30% of the insolation is reflected back to space, meaning that remaining 0.7 or 70% is absorbed within the climate system.</p>
<p>It turns out that within Earth’s climate system there is very little reflection of <a class="reference internal" href="#term-longwave-radiation"><span class="xref std std-term">longwave radiation</span></a>, which is why albedo is only associated with shortwave radiation.</p>
<p>(Technically, albedo is a <em>spectral</em> property: the precise albedo of a given material depends on the precise wavelength of the radiation incident on that material, not just the bulk SW vs. LW.  So, formally, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha=\alpha(\lambda)\)</span>.  But in the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-two-stream-approximation"><span class="xref std std-term">two-stream approximation</span></a>, we treat it as being a bulk property of just the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-shortwave-radiation"><span class="xref std std-term">shortwave radiation</span></a>,)</p>

<dt id="term-anthropogenic">anthropogenic<a class="headerlink" href="#term-anthropogenic" title="Link to this term">#</a></dt><dd><p>A fancy term for <em>caused by humans</em>.  As opposed to <em>natural</em>, <em>naturally occuring</em>, etc.</p>
<p>So, for example, we can distinguish between <em>natural climate changes</em> on the one hand (as occur, say, between the ice ages and interglacial periods due to the planet’s naturally occuring orbital fluctuations), with, on the other hand, <em>anthropogenic climate change</em> which is the set of ongoing changes to Earth’s climate caused by human activities.</p>

The sun and Earth’s surface can be approximated as perfect blackbodies, whereas Earth’s atmosphere is an imperfect blackbody, meaning it has an <a class="reference internal" href="#term-emissivity"><span class="xref std std-term">emissivity</span></a> that is less than one.</p>

<dt id="term-climate-model">climate model<a class="headerlink" href="#term-climate-model" title="Link to this term">#</a></dt><dd><p>A representation of Earth’s climate system on a computer, usually a supercomputer.  Traditionally, they work by chunking the ocean, atmosphere, and land into lots of small <em>gridboxes</em> (though the shapes aren’t always a simple box) and solving the equations of motion, equations of radiative transfer, and equations representing other key processes forward in time.</p>
<p>The laws of nature and the real Earth are <em>continuous</em>, whereas a computer treats things as <em>discrete</em>: climate model gridboxes have finite sizes, and the climate model advances forward in time in discrete finite chunks, e.g. 30 minutes per <em>timestep</em>.  This creates all sorts of biases and uncertainties.</p>

<dt id="term-Clausius-Clapeyron">Clausius-Clapeyron<a class="headerlink" href="#term-Clausius-Clapeyron" title="Link to this term">#</a></dt><dd><p>The equation from thermodynamics that gives rise to the roughly exponential increase in saturation specific humidity with warming, at a rate of approximately <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7\%\text{ K}^{-1}\)</span>.</p>

<p>For a given field of interest—meaning the physical quantity, time period, and spatial region—and a given future scenario of interest, suppose that all of the available state-of-the-art climate models perform the identical simulation.  Because of differences in how the models are formulated, there will be differences across the models in the change in the particular field.</p>
<p>Be aware:  in this example, if only a single run is performed with each model, there will also be a contribution to the across-model differences from <a class="reference internal" href="#term-internal-variability"><span class="xref std std-term">internal variability</span></a>: each model’s simulation will have its own unique realization of its internal weather and other natural fluctuations, in addition to the differences across models due to their different formulations.</p>
<p>As such, a better experimental design to isolate model uncertainty is for each model to perform a large <em>ensemble</em> of runs, each identically forced but starting from slightly different initial conditions.  Then, averaging across each model’s ensemble would act to remove the internal variability component, and then one would compare these individual model ensemble averages across the models.</p>

After they retreat in the subsequent <em>interglacial</em> period such as we’re in right now, the land that was underneath them gradually rises up.  This acts to reduce local sea level.</p>
<p>The growth and retreat of the ice sheets also indirectly causes the nearby land surface to move up and down even past where the ice sheet ever reached: when the ice sheet pushes the land beneath it down, some of the crust also gets pushed out to the side in addition to downward.  This adds land mass to adjacent areas and thus causes the land surface there to go up, decreasing the local sea level.  Going from the glacial to the interglacial, the reverse process occurs: where the ice retreats, the land moves up but also some crust flows toward it, which acts to decrease the surface height in adjacent areas and thus cause local sea level rise.</p>

<p>Think of it as quantifying how “hard” the system has been hit: the larger the radiative forcing, the more the climate will have to change in order to reach a new equilibrium that balances that radiative forcing.</p>
<p>Physical dimensions are power per unit area, and so SI units are Watts per square meter.  Signed positive <em>downward</em>: positive if there’s a net <em>surplus</em> of radiation entering the climate system, i.e. more radiation absorbed than emitted.  Negative if, instead, there’s a net <em>deficit</em>: more being emitted to space than being absorbed.</p>
<p>The example of our particular interest is the radiative forcing due to an instantaneous doubling of atmospheric <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span>, which is approximately <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\text{ W m}^{-2}\)</span>.  But the concept of radiative forcing can be applied to any other imposed perturbation to the climate system too, e.g. historical <a class="reference internal" href="#term-anthropogenic"><span class="xref std std-term">anthropogenic</span></a> aerosol emissions, or changes in <a class="reference internal" href="#term-insolation"><span class="xref std std-term">insolation</span></a> due to solar cycles or orbital variations.</p>
<p>It’s not something that can be directly measured, so we infer it from climate model simulations.</p>
<p>(Strictly speaking, there is a meaningful distinction between the TOA imbalance that arises <em>instantaneously</em> after the perturbation is applied and the TOA imbalance after say a few weeks, a time period that’s long enough that the atmosphere adjusts to some extent but short enough that the more sluggish surface temperature hasn’t changed much yet.  The TOA imbalance after this “rapid adjustment” is referred to as <em>effective radiative forcing</em> (ERF), and long-term warming is better predicted by the ERF than the <em>instantaneous</em> radiative forcing.
