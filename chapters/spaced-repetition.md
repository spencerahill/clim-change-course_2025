# Spaced repetition and Anki

## Wait, doesn't the rise of AI make rote memorization worthless?
No!

True understanding of complicated concepts will be valuable, and arguably increasingly so, with the rise of AI

And understanding a complicated concept requires memorizing its ”subcomponent” concepts!

## Underlying concepts
{term}`forgetting curve`: our ability to recall a concept typically follows a forgetting curve, which decreases rapidly (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve#/media/File%3AForgetting_curve_decline.svg)

But every time you successfully recall a concept, you flatten the forgetting curve: {term}`spacing effect` (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve#/media/File:ForgettingCurve.svg)

As such, you can space out reviews of a topic more and more: this is {term}`spaced repetition` (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#/media/File%3ALeitner_system_alternative.svg)

## Why not just review all your flashcards every day?
It just takes too much time!

Personal example: I currently have 527 cards in my main Anki deck, and 336 in my Español deck, so 863 total

If I spent just 2 seconds per card, that would take ~30 minutes every day to review them all

In fact, I average more like 10+ seconds per card: hours every day!  Just not practical.

## Enter Anki
Doing this with physical flashcards is cumbersome, so I’m recommending a free app Anki: https://apps.ankiweb.net/ 

## Reviewing cards
When a card shows up, bring your answer to mind, or even say it out loud to yourself.

Then, click the "Show Answer" button, or press Spacebar.

The card's answer will appear, along with four choices: Again, Hard, Medium, Easy.  Select the appropriate one.

Based on your selection, Anki will update the amount of time it will let pass before it shows you that card again.

Do this *every day*.  Or, at least, every *weekday* (I don't use it on Saturdays.)  It will only take a few minutes each time.  

Keep adding cards!  Start prepping now for the final exam:

You could create cards for the data analysis material too: for example, create cards to help you memorize Python syntax ("What's the python code to define a variable named `my_number` with a value 158.23?").

## Beyond this class
There is nothing unique to this class in terms of using Anki: you can use it for all your classes, and in fact for *anything* you want to learn or remember better.

I use it to better remember all key concepts that underlie my research and teaching.  I also use it to better remember the names of movies I've watched and as I'm attempting to re-learn Spanish.

## Assigment
1. Create a free Anki account at https://apps.ankiweb.net/ 
2. Download and install the free Anki desktop app (If you don't have your own computer handy, use their web-based portal for now.  Then download the desktop app and sync your online deck to the app.)
3. Create an Anki Deck and populate it with cards on the above material spaced repetition.
4. Do all of the previous steps ASAP!  Then, review your Anki cards following its system *every day* between now and next class
5. *Keep up with this the rest of the semester*!
