## Introductory lecture (2025/2/5)

{term}`inverse square law`: dependence of stellar radiation, in $\text{W m}^{-2}$, on a star’s luminosity and orbital distance

This is *the* starting point for Earth's climate: how much energy does Earth get from the sun?

## Basic properties of Earth's climate (various lectures)

### Atmospheric structure 

Vertical structure: {term}`troposphere` is lowest ~10-15 km, where ~all weather happens, and above it is the {term}`stratosphere`, separated by the {term}`tropopause`

{term}`top of atmosphere` is where planetary energy balance is determined: for balance, must have the sum total of all radiative fluxes *in* equal to the sum total of all radiative fluxes *out*

Horizontal structure: {term}`tropics` vs. extratropics

Tropics further subdivided into **deep tropics** (~15$^\circ$S-15$^\circ$N) and **subtropics** (~15$^\circ$S-30$^\circ$S and ~15$^\circ$N-30$^\circ$N)

Extratropics further subdivided into **midlatitudes** (~30$^\circ$S-60$^\circ$S and ~30$^\circ$N-60$^\circ$N) and **high latitudes** (~60$^\circ$S-90$^\circ$S and ~60$^\circ$N-90$^\circ$N)

### Moisture

{term}`specific humidity` ($q$): in a given volume, (kg water vapor) / (kg air)

{term}`saturation`: when air is at exact temperature and amount of moisture set by {term}`Clausius-Clapeyron` such that any more water vapor (or any cooling) would cause the water vapor to start condensing out into liquid or ice water

{term}`saturation specific humidity`: value of $q$ at saturation

{term}`relative humidity`: (actual specific humidity) / (saturation specific humidity)

## Greenhouse effect (2025/2/19)

### Fundamentals
{term}`blackbody` radiation and {term}`Stefan-Boltzmann law`: $E=\sigma T^4$

{term}`two-band approximation`: {term}`shortwave radiation` emitted by sun (abbreviated SW), vs. {term}`longwave radiation` emitted by Earth (abbreviated LW)

{term}`transmission` (photon passes through) vs. {term}`scattering` (photon reflected) vs. {term}`absorption` (photon absorbed and ceases to exist)

### Planetary energy balance

{term}`insolation`: **in**coming **sol**ar radia**tion**

planetary {term}`albedo` ($\alpha_p$): fraction of insolation reflected back to space; thus the fraction $1-\alpha_p$ is absorbed by the climate system

{term}`outgoing longwave radiation` (OLR) and corresponding {term}`emission temperature`: $T_E=(OLR/\sigma)^{1/4}$

All {term}`insolation` passes through a disk w/ Earth’s radius, so area $\pi a^2$ where $a$ is Earth's radius, Whereas OLR is emitted over surface area of Earth, so area $4\pi a^2$.  This difference in the areas between the SW and LW is why the 1/4 factor appears in the planetary energy balance temperature

### Greenhouse effect

{term}`greenhouse effect`: surface is warmer than the emission temperature due to absorption and re-emission of LW radiation by the atmosphere

This absoprtion and reemission is done by {term}`greenhouse gas` molecules

Key ones are CO2 and water vapor.

Water vapor is arguably single most important greenhouse gas 

But its concentration is set by temperature via Clausius Clapeyron: for fixed relative humidity, warmer = more water vapor = more greenhouse

So better thought of as a feedback than a forcing

Whereas CO2, humans are emitting more into the atmosphere, causing warming and associated radiative feedbacks and other climate system responses

### 1-layer greenhouse model
If there was no {term}`greenhouse effect`, the surface temperature and {term}`emission temperature` would be identical: the photons emitted by the surface would all escape to space.

That's a good description of the moon, which basically has no atmosphere and thus no {term}`greenhouse effect`.  But it's a bad description of Earth.

The simplest {term}`analytical framework` that we can use to represent the greenhouse effect is the {temr}`one-layer greenhouse model`.

### Emission height and lapse rate

#### For unperturbed climate (i.e. unchanged CO2 amount)

{term}`emission height`: determined directly by the atmospheric composition, i.e. how many molecules there are of the various greenhouse gases (GHGs)

For Earth combining all the GHGs, this is ~5-6 km

{term}`lapse rate`: change in temperature with height, with sign flipped.  

Within the troposphere, the lowest atmospheric layer, the lapse rate on average is ~6 K/km

#### Under *increased* CO2: (emission height rises) + (~fixed lapse rate) = (surface warming)
More CO2 = vertically higher emission height = colder temperature = less blackbody radiation = less OLR

Must increase temperature at this new emission height to the original one

If lapse rate fixed, this requires shifting the whole temperature profile toward higher values

Results in warming at the surface (and the whole troposphere)

### Spectral nature of radiation

Bulk SW and LW categories are in fact averages over large bands of wavelengths: ~0.1-2 microns for SW, ~5-80 microns for LW

{term}`absorption band`: greenhouse gases are those gases that have absorption bands within the overall LW part of the spectrum

E.g. CO2 15 micron band: absorbs radiation emitted at and near 15 microns

The location and strength of the absorption bands is determined by quantum mechanics and each molecule’s structure

### Radiative forcing

{term}`anthropogenic` = caused by humans

{term}`radiative forcing`: Immediate change in TOA net radiative flux after some change has been imposed within the climate

E.g. suppose CO2 was instantly doubled, the best estimate is that this would cause a ~4 W/m^2 imbalance at TOA, meaning the climate system is
receiving 4 W/m^2 more than it is emitting to space

A nonzero radiative forcing means causes the climate system to respond in order to reach a new equilbrium

## Temperature (2025/2/26, 3/5)

### Climate sensitivity

{term}`climate sensitivity`: global-mean surface air temperature change in response to a given {term}`radiative forcing`, usually a CO2 doubling.

{term}`equilibrium climate sensitivity` vs. {term}`transient climate sensitivity`: ~1000s of years for equilibrium vs. ~1st century after a radiative forcing is introduced for transient.

Why?  Right now, ~90% of extra energy being absorbed in response to the increased CO2 is being absorbed by the ocean, and virtually all of that in a thin layer near the surface (say the first km, or even less).  The deep ocean (from ~1 km to bottom) is *huge* heat reservoir, but takes up heat from near surface *very* slowly, so it takes 1000s of years for it to fully equilibrate

Thus, equilibrium warming can be substantially greater than the transient warming

### Radiative feedbacks

{term}`radiative feedback`

{term}`negative feedback` and {term}`positive feedback`

{term}`Planck feedback`

{term}`water vapor feedback`

{term}`lapse rate feedback`

{term}`surface albedo feedback`

{term}`cloud feedback`


### Others

{term}`polar amplification` and its 3 main contributing factors: Planck, lapse rate, and surface albedo feedbacks

{term}`hiatus periods` and their underlying cause: long-term trend ((a.k.a. *secular* trend) with natural variability overlaid

{term}`stratospheric cooling` in response to increased CO2, at the same time as troposphere underneath warms

## Clouds (2025/3/6, 2025/3/12)
### Basics

{term}`cloud`

3 key types in terms of vertical structure: {term}`low cloud`, {term}`high cloud`, {term}`cumulonimbus`

Liquid vs. ice: liquid if air is ~above freezing, ice if much below freezing, can be "mixed-phase" with both ice and liquid present if temperature is intermediate (between 0 and -40 Celsius)

### Cloud radiative effect
{term}`cloud radiative effect` (CRE): all-sky TOA radiative flux minus clear-sky TOA radiative flux, in Watts per meter squared

Can consider SW and LW separately: SW CRE and LW CRE, or add them to get the *net* CRE = SW CRE + LW CRE

#### SW CRE
All clouds have high albedo: more SW reflected back to space compared to if that cloud was absent

So SW CRE ~always *negative*: clouds cause *less* SW to be absorbed by the climate system

(Quantitative value depends on the cloud's own albedo relative to the underlying surface albedo)

#### LW CRE:
Clouds are ~blackbodies: LW emission varies with $T^4$

Being H2O, clouds strongly absorb LW

Combined: they absorb LW emitted below them, then re-emit it at their local temperature

So if they are much cooler than the surface, they will absorb higher-energy photons emitted from the surface then re-emit them out to space as lower-energy photons

This acts to trap energy in the climate system

Since clouds are almost always colder than the surface, or at most roughly the same temperature, the result is that the LW CRE is ~always *positive*

#### Dependence of LW, SW, and net CRE on cloud type:
Low clouds:
- nearly as warm as surface, so little LW trapping: LW CRE $\approx0$
- So SW reflection wins out, resulting in *negative* net CRE: low clouds act to *cool* Earth

High clouds:
- much colder than surface, so *strong* LW trapping: LW CRE$>0$
- Also tend to be ice and wispy compared to thicker, low clouds, so SW reflection isn't as strong
- So LW wins out over SW, resulting in *positive* net CRE: high clouds act to *warm* Earth

Cumulonimbus:
- deep towers, so both very strong SW reflection *and* LW absorption
- the SW and LW tend to nearly cancel within the cumulonimbus tower, leading to net CRE$\approx0$ (albeit slightly positive)
- (outside the core tower: cumulonimbus *anvils* are large contributor to total high cloud amount)

Total, combining all clouds: SW CRE ~ -50 W/m2, LW CRE ~+30 W/m2, so net CRE ~ -20 W/m2

### Moist convection

{term}`moist static energy`: $h=c_pT+gz+L_vq$, a.k.a. MSE

{term}`adiabatic`: MSE conserved

buoyant near surface air + approximately moist adiabatic ascent (i.e. moist static energy unchanged), so a cloud will form near the surface and extend vertically to the level above where the MSE once again equals the near-surface MSE

### Cloud microphysics

Cloud radiative properties depend both on total amount of liquid and ice water but also how that water is distributed into individual cloud droplets and cloud ice particles

Shortwave: cloud albedo *increases* as cloud droplet radius decreases due to (1) greater total droplet surface area and (2) closer in size to SW wavelengths, which makes scattering more effective

Longwave: less dependence on droplet radius.  Instead, total amount of liquid or ice is what matters.

{term}`cloud condensation nuclei`: an {term}`aerosol` needs to be present for water vapor to condense onto, forming a cloud droplet.

More aerosols present = more, smaller cloud droplets (for a fixed total amount of water)

### Cloud feedbacks
Net cloud feedback reflects the net effect of *all* changes to clouds per Kelvin warming

Lots of processes on lots of scales, many of them unresolved by climate models, makes them very
uncertain

Best estimate is slightly positive (amplifying) global-mean feedback

But large uncertainty and in fact single largest contributor to uncertainty in net climate feedback parameter and thus in equilibrium climate
sensitivity

## Uncertainty sources, c.f. *Hawkins and Sutton 2007* (2025/3/12)

{term}`climate model`: numerical models that simulate Earth's climate, run on supercomputers, which we use to project future warming

{term}`aerosol`: microscopic solid particles floating in the atmosphere.  E.g. dust, sea salt (both natural) and sulfates from combustion (anthropogenic).  Varies by species, but on net they reflect SW back to space, thus acting to *cool* the climate.

{term}`internal variability`: natural wiggles, from day-to-day weather to decade-to-decade warmer or cooler periods.  These are not caused by human activities; they are intrinsic features of the climate system.  Hence they are also called *natural* variability.

{term}`model uncertainty`: for a given forcing, how much *spread* there is across simulations by different climate models in the response

{term}`scenario uncertainty`: what will society *do* in the future?  Will society decarbonize rapidly?  If yes, all else equal, we'd expect less warming compared to if, instead, society further accelerates its use of fossil fuels.

## Sea level rise (2025/3/19)

{term}`sea level rise` (SLR)

{term}`land ice`: {term}`glacier`s and {term}`ice sheet`s

{term}`post-glacial rebound`

{term}`sea ice` (doesn't change sea level)

{term}`steric sea level rise`: SLR due purely to thermal expansion, not change in total water volume

### Global vs. local sea level rise

Global mean sea level rise causes:
1. thermal expansion: {term}`steric sea level rise`
2. melt of ice sheets and mountain glaciers: the melted water runs off eventually into the ocean
3. changes in land water storage: dams increase it, groundwater pumping decreases it

Local sea level change causes:
- Atmospheric pressure loading
- Wind stress
- Storm and tidal surges
- Coastal erosion and land subsidence
- Post-glacial rebound and isostatic adjustment
- Gravitational effects of ice sheet melt


## Sea ice (2025/4/2, 4/9) 

:::{note}
The sea ice material that was covered in the HW assignment of group/individual presentations will *not* appear on the exam.
:::

### Basics

{term}`sea ice`: ice floating in sea or ocean.  As opposed to land ice.

Recall: land ice melt contributes to sea level rise, sea ice melt does not

Consists of many individual ice {term}`floe`s, ranging from a few cm to 100s of km 

Very well observed in the **satellite era** = since 1979

### Metrics
{term}`sea ice area`: area covered by sea ice

{term}`sea ice age`: how long ago the sea ice formed

{term}`sea ice concentration`: fraction of a given gridbox that is covered by sea ice

{term}`sea ice extent`: area spanned by gridboxes with sea ice concentratrion >=15%

{term}`sea ice thickness`: vertical span of the sea ice from its bottom to its top

### Observed trends, Arctic vs. Antarctic
Arctic: all metrics show clear trends toward decreasing ice: less area, thinner, younger, etc.

Antarctic: no clear trends over satellite era as a whole

### Future projections, Arctic vs. Antarctic
Both similar to *observed trends*: strong evidence for continued future decreases for Arctic, vs. a much more mixed signal for Antarctic

### Using climate model *control runs* to assess role of natural variability in observed trends
Motivating question: how likely or not is it that the observed ~40-year Arctic sea ice trends were actually due to {term}`internal variability`---rather than *forced* by {term}`anthropogenic` increases in {term}`greenhouse gas` concentrations?

In a {term}`control simulation`, all greenhouse gas concentrations and other boundary conditions are fixed, unchanging.  And the simulation is run for hundreds or thousands of years, so that you get a lot of data.

As such, any variations that arise in the simulation *must* be due to {term}`internal variability`.

So one can examine the *distribution* of ~40-year trends in Arctic sea ice in the long-running control simulation.  Most will be near zero, and larger trends, both positive and negative, occur much less frequently.

If the observed trend falls within the model's range of *naturally caused* trends, that suggests that the observed signal *could* be mostly due to natural causes.

Whereas if the observed trend falls far *outside* the model's distribution, that suggests that the observed signal is most likely due to the anthropogenic forcing.

For the observed Arctic sea ice trend, this exercise indicates that the trends are indeed *far* beyond what could be credibly explained solely by natural variability.

## Tropical cyclones (2025/4/23)

{term}`tropical cyclone`, a.k.a. TC.

Regional names: a.k.a. {term}`hurricane` for North Atlantic and NE Pacific, a.k.a. {term}`typhoon` in NW Pacific

Spin **counterclockwise** in northern hemisphere and **clockwise** in southern hemisphere

### Formation

**Coriolis parameter** ($f=2\Omega\sin\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is latitude): tells you the amount of rotation the spinning Earth is imparting in the horizontal direction at the given latitude.  Why does it vary with latitude this way?
- at the pole: surface is exactly perpendicular to the rotation axis, so Earth's spin is exactly aligned with the horizontal plane
- at the equator: surface is exactly *parallel* with the rotation axis, so Earth's spin does *not* project onto the horizontal plane at all.
- in between: at an angle, so it's in between
  
TCs form due to warm, moist air over the tropical oceans that gets organized into big spinning systems via the **Coriolis** effect

This is why TCs never form in the band directly around the equator: Coriolis is too small there

:::{note}
*2025 spring: I've decided *not* to include the Carnot cycle material on the final exam.  I'm leaving it here in case you just want to review it for your own sake, but there will be no questions on it.*

We can usefully approximate them as {term}`Carnot cycle` heat engines, with each of the 4 stages:
1. **isothermal expansion**: inflow near surface at fixed temperature but gains heat from water vapor evaporated from ocean
2. **adiabatic expansion**: ascent concentrated at the **eyewall**, roughly adiabatic, expanding and cooling (and raining) as it goes up
3. **isothermal compression**: outflow near the tropopause loses energy through emitting LW 
4. **adiabatic compression**: descent in the outer region of the TC, compressing and heating up as it sinks to higher pressures

### Hurricane trends and future projections

In short, trends are fairly weak and future uncertainty is very large!

(This is one of most acute instances of discrepancies between the *mainstream scientific consensus* regarding climate change and how the *public messaging* regarding climate change.)

## Atmospheric circulation (2025/4/30, 5/7)

### Coordinates and velocities
Horizontal coordinates and names:
- Longitude: east-west = **zonal** 
- Latitude: north-south = **meridional**

Velocity components: 
- $u$ for *zonal* wind, positive eastward
- $v$ for *meridional wind$, positive northward

Velocity direction name conventions:
- **southerly** means from the south: $v>0$, **northerly** means *from* the north: $v<0$, 
- **westerly** means *from* the west: $u>0$, **easterly** means *from* the east: $u<0$

Averages:
- zonal average, a.k.a. zonal mean: At each latitude, average the values over all *longitudes*
- time average, a.k.a. time mean: average over the values at all times

Earth spins from west to east

### Main circulation features
{term}`Hadley cells`: time-mean, zonal-mean overturning circulation in the {term}`tropics`

{term}`Intertropical Convergence Zone` (ITCZ): intense rain band in the deep tropics driven by the upward motion of warm, moist air in the ascending branch of the {term}`Hadley cells`

**jet streams**: in the upper troposphere subtropics/mid-latitudes, time-mean, zonal-mean fast, westerly flow (up to ~40 m/s)

**eddies**: everything other than the time-mean, zonal-mean circulation.  For our purposes, the ones that matter most are the big traveling storms in the extratropics called "baroclinic eddies"

### Angular momentum
#### Basics
**angular momentum** per unit mass = (distance from rotation axis) x (linear speed in m/s in the direction of rotation)

**angular momentum conservation**: unless there is a torque, angular momentum is conserved.  So moving closer to rotation axis requires spinning up, and moving away from rotation axis requires spinning down

For air in Earth's atmosphere, two contributions to its angular momentum:
1. angular momentum of the solid Earth at the given latitude.  Equator is farthest from the rotation axis, and the poles are directly on the rotation axis.
2. angular momentum due to the air's motion *relative* to the solid Earth.  This depends solely on its zonal velocity $u$.  Since Earth spins west to east, $u>0$ corresponds to positive angular momentum (meaning same sign as Earth's angular momentum).

**thin shell**: vertical extent of Earth's atmosphere is *much* smaller than radius of solid Earth.  So with respect to angular momentum conservation etc., we ignore vertial motion within the atmosphere, and worry only about latitude.

#### Using angular momentum and Hadley cells to understand the jet streams
Air ascends near equator and moves poleward in upper troposphere of the Hadley cell upper branches

Away from surface, very little friction (and thus very little *torque*).  So angular momentum roughly conserved.

Air moves closer to the rotation axis as it moves poleward.  To conserve angular momentum, this requires its flow to become more westerly: $u$ must increase.

This continues all the way to the subtropics where the Hadley cells terminate in either hemisphere, resulting in each hemisphere's **jet stream**.

#### Eddy transports of angular momentum

Important: you will *not* be tested on the "Reynolds decomposition" formal equation decomposing into mean meridional circulation and eddy terms.

But you do need to understand the following *conceptually*:
- The angular momentum transports just described were by the Hadley cells, which are the time-mean, zonal-mean circulation
- Eddies can also transport angular momentum and other tracers like moisture and heat
- For example, in the rotating tank with the cold source in the middle, the eddies moved warm water toward the middle and moved cold water toward the outside.  Both of those act to transport heat *inward*, toward the cold source.

## Mean precipitation change (2025/5/7)

### Time-mean atmospheric water vapor budget

There must be a balance between the *source*, *sink*, and *transport* terms.  Specifically, at any given location, these must sum to zero:
1. **precipitation**.  This is the *sink* term: atmosphere *loses* water molecules when they get rained/snowed out
2. **evaporation**.  This is the *source* term: atmosphere *gains* water molecules when they get evaporated out of the surface *into* the atmosphere
3. **water vapor divergence**: This is the *transport* term: if winds *converge* water vapor into the region, it acts to increase the amount of water vapor.  If conversely winds *diverge* water vapor out of the region, it acts to decrease the amount of water vapor.

We can create a combined *net source* term by subtracting evaporation from precipitation: $P-E$.
- If $P-E>0$, more water vapor is lost through precip than is gained through evaporation.  The circulation must therefore *converge* water vapor into the region to maintain balance.
- If $P-E<0$, less water vapor is lost through precip than is gained through evaporation.  The circulation must therefore *diverge* water vapor out of the region to maintain balance.

In terms of surface "wetness", we think of $P-E>0$ as wet regions with lots of rainfall, such as the deep tropics and mid latitudes, and we think of $P-E<0$ as dry, desert regions as mostly occur in the subtropics.

### Simple but powerful scaling argument for future $P-E$ change.

This is known as **rich-get-richer**: a.k.a. **wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier**; a.k.a. **thermodynamic scaling**.

Big picture: wet areas---meaning areas where $P-E>0$ in the original, unperturbed climate---will tend to get *even wetter*, i.e. $\delta(P-E)>0$, as the planet warms.  Conversely, dry areas---meaning areas where $P-E<0$ in the original, unperturbed climate---will tend to get *even drier*, i.e. $\delta(P-E)<0$, as the planet warms.

This simple scaling captures the changes in zonal-mean $P-E$ projected by climate model simulations under increased CO2 surprisingly well: broadly, $\delta(P-E)>0$ in the deep tropics and mid-latitudes vs. $\delta(P-E)<0$ in the subtropics.

Chain of argument:
1. Relative humidity doesn't change much, so change in specific humidity dictated by Clausius-Clapeyron: increases by ~7% / K warming
2. Surface temperature change, $\delta T$, is fairly uniform
3. Changes in moisture transport divergence/convergence---which, recall, must balance any change in $P-E$---is dominated by changes in near-surface specific humidity.  (In other words, we neglect the influence of changes in specific humidity higher up in the atmosphere, and we also neglect the influence of changes in the wind fields.)

Combined, these lead to $\delta(P-E)=\alpha_{CC}(P-E)\delta T$, where
- $\delta(P-E)$ is the *change* in $P-E$
- $\alpha_{CC}\approx 7\%$/K comes from Clausius-Clapeyron
- $\delta T$ is the global-mean surface air temperature change
- $(P-E)$ on the right-hand-side is the *original* value of $P-E$ prior to warming
