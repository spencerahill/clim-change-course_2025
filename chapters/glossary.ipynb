    "absorption\n",
    "  In radiative transfer, when a photon hits a molecule, exciting the molecule, and gets destroyed in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To be contrasted with {term}`scattering` (a.k.a. reflection) and {term}`transmission`\n",
    "\n",
    "absorption band\n",
    "  In atmospheric radiative transfer, a band of wavelengths where one or more of the greenhouse gases strongly absorbs electromagnetic radiation.  For example, carbon dioxide strongly absorbs radiation in a band centered at a wavelength of 15 microns.  There are several other important absorption bands coming from carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Within absorption bands, the {term}`absorptivity` is close to 1, meaning most photons get absorbed.  Outside absorption bands, absorptivity is close to zero, meaning most photons pass through without being absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "absorptivity\n",
    "  The fraction of electromagnetic radiation at a given wavelength that gets absorbed.  Identical to the {term}`emissivity` at that wavelength (by Kirchoff's law).  See {term}`emissivity` for more.\n",
    "\n",
    "aerosol\n",
    "  A small solid particle in the atmosphere.  There are naturally occuring atmospheres such as sea salt and dust.  There are also anthropogenic aerosols such as sulfate and smoke from combustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The precise radiative properties varies a lot across aerosol species.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  With respect to historical emissions of aerosols by humans, overall they have slightly increased the planetary {term}`albedo` by directly {term}`scattering` {term}`shortwave radiation` back to space, which constitutes a negative {term}`radiative forcing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  They have contributed an even more negative---but highly uncertain---negative radiative forcing through their influece on cloud {term}`albedo` via their role as cloud condensation nuclei.\n",
    "\n",
    "albedo \n",
    "  The fraction of the sun's radiation that is reflected back to space.  It is a dimensionless quantity and thus unitless.  Usually denoted with a Greek lower-case alpha, $\\alpha$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The *planetary* albedo, meaning the global-mean, time-mean value of the albedo at the {term}`top of atmosphere` is often denoted $\\alpha_p$ and for Earth's present climate is approximately 0.3: approximately 30% of the insolation is reflected back to space, meaning that remaining 0.7 or 70% is absorbed within the climate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "  It turns out that within Earth's climate system there is very little reflection of {term}`longwave radiation`, which is why albedo is only associated with shortwave radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (Technically, albedo is a *spectral* property: the precise albedo of a given material depends on the precise wavelength of the radiation incident on that material: $\\alpha=\\alpha(\\lambda)$.  But in the {term}`two-stream approximation`, we treat it as being a bulk property of just the {term}`shortwave radiation`,)\n",
    "\n",
    "blackbody\n",
    "  A body that emits electromagnetic radiation according to the {term}`Stefan-Boltzmann law`.  The sun and Earth's surface can be approximated as perfect blackbodies, whereas Earth's atmosphere is an imperfect blackbody, meaning it has an {term}`emissivity` that is less than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "climate model\n",
    "  A representation of Earth's climate system on a computer, usually a supercomputer.  Traditionally, they work by chunking the ocean, atmosphere, and land into lots of small *gridboxes* (though the shapes aren't always a simple box) and solving the equations of motion, equations of radiative transfer, and equations representing other key processes forward in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The laws of nature and the real Earth are *continuous*, whereas a computer treats things as *discrete*: climate model gridboxes have finite sizes, and the climate model advances forward in time in discrete finite chunks, e.g. 30 minutes per *timestep*.  This creates all sorts of biases and uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clausius-Clapeyron\n",
    "  The equation from thermodynamics that gives rise to the roughly exponential increase in saturation specific humidity with warming, at a rate of approximately $7\\%\\text{ K}^{-1}$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "  Insofar as the {term}`relative humidity` stays fixed, this 7% increase per Kelvin warming extends to the specific humidity too.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  (More formally, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation specifies the dependence of saturation vapor pressure on temperature: $d\\ln e^*/dT=L_v/(R_vT^2)$, where $e^*$ is saturation vapor pressure, $T$ is temperature, $L_v=2.5\\times10^6\\text{ J kg}^{-1}$ is the latent heat of vaporization, and $R_v=461.5\\text{ J kg}^{-1}\\text{ K}^{-1}$ is the specific gas constant of water vapor.  Plugging those values of $L_v$ and $R_v$ in and using temperature ranges within the troposphere, so $T\\sim200$ to $300\\text{ K}$, yields the approximate $7\\%\\text{ K}^{-1}$ scaling.)\n",
    "\n",
    "climate sensitivity\n",
    "  The global-mean surface temperature change caused by an abrupt doubling of atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration.  Units Kelvin or degrees Celsius.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  There are two meaningful variants: {term}`equilibrium climate sensitivity` and {term}`transient climate sensitivity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  This cannot be directly observed: we don't have a 2nd Earth available where we can instantly double CO$_2$ and then watch equilibrate over thousands of years.  It therefore must be estimated using climate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "cloud feedback\n",
    "  The {term}`radiative feedback` due to changes in cloud properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "  These are highly uncertain, due to the large number of processes involved and the vast range of underlying physical scales, from micron-scale changes in e.g. cloud droplet size that influence cloud {term}`albedo` all the way up to changes in planetary-scale flow patterns that influence the overall location, extent, and height of different cloud types.\n",
    "\n",
    "emission height\n",
    "  The height above the surface at which the atmospheric temperature is equal to the blackbody temperature corresponding to Earth's outgoing longwave radiation (OLR).  Physical dimensions are height, so SI units are meters, but it's usually expressed in kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Considering the global mean, for Earth's present climate the emission height is roughly 5-6 km above the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "emission temperature\n",
    "  Given the planet's global-mean {term}`outgoing longwave radiation` (OLR) in Watts per square meter, the corresponding {term}`blackbody temperature`.  Usually denoted $T_E$.  Physical dimensions temperature; SI units Kelvin.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Symbolically, using the {term}`Stefan-Boltzmann law` for the blackbody radiation, we have $T_E=(\\text{OLR}/\\sigma)^{1/4}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "emissivity\n",
    "  Given the amount of radiation emitted by a body $E$ and its actual temperature $T$, the fraction that radiation is compared to if the body was a perfect blackbody.  Dimensionless and therefore unitless.  Denoted with a lower-case Greek epsilon, $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Putting the above description symbolically: $\\epsilon=E/(\\sigma T^4)$, since by {term}{Stefan-Boltzmann law} the blackbody radiation is $\\sigma T^4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  It is a *spectral* property, meaning it depends on the wavelength of the radiation being considered: $\\epsilon=\\epsilon(\\lambda)$.  For Earth's atmosphere, there are {term}`absorption band` within the {term}`longwave radiation` portion of the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "  At any wavelength, it is identical to the {term}`absorptivity` (by Kirchoff's law): if a body emits 70\\% of the radiation at a given wavelength that a blackbody would at the same temperature, it also *absorbs* 70% of the radiation at that wavelength that it receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "equilibrium climate sensitivity\n",
    "  The {term}`climate sensitivity` after the whole climate system, including the deep ocean, reaches a new equilibrium state.  Because heat transfer within the deep ocean is very slow, this takes thousands of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "greenhouse gas\n",
    "  A molecule in Earth's atmosphere that significantly absorbs {term}`longwave radiation`.  The two most important ones are carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) and water vapor (H$_2$O).  Others include methane (CH$_4$), nitrous oxide (N$_2$O), and ozone (O$_3$)\n",
    "\n",
    "insolation\n",
    "  A contraction of the phrase \"**in**coming **sol**ar radi**ation**\": the amount of solar radiation incident at Earth's {term}`top of atmosphere`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "internal variability\n",
    "  A.k.a. \"natural variability.\"  The naturally occuring ~random-ish fluctuations that occur on many different timescales in Earth's atmosphere and ocean.  Even for global-mean surface temperature, such internal variability can result in several years or even multiple decades of warming or cooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "  That is even more true for smaller spatial scales.  In general, the smaller the timescale and/or spatial scale, the greater influence internal variability will have on the behavior relative to other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kelvin\n",
    "  Absolute temperature, such that zero Kelvin equals [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero).  Abbreviated K.  The SI unit for temperature.  Equal to degrees Celsius plus 273.15.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Because it has the identical *spacing* as degrees Celsius, for quantities that represent *differences* in temperature the two units can be used interchangeably.  For example, when we say the planet warms up by a given amount, that refers to the new temperature *minus* the old temperature, and so it is \n",
    "\n",
    "  Conversely, if we were talking about Earth's current global-mean temperature, which is approximately 288 Kelvin, that is **not** the same as $288^\\circ\\text{C}$.  It *is* the same as $288-273.15=14.85^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Another example, we can say that the average {term}`lapse rate` in the troposphere is approximately 6 Kelvin per kilometer, or just as well that it is 6 degrees Celsius per kilometer.  That's because the lapse rate is the *change* in temperature with height, i.e. the (infinitesimal) difference in temperature between two adjacent heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "lapse rate\n",
    "  The change in temperature with height, with sign flipped.  Usually denoted with a capital Gamma $\\Gamma$: $\\Gamma\\equiv-\\partial T/\\partial z$.  Physical dimensions are temperature divided by height, so SI units are Kelvin divided by meters, but the denominator is often expressed in kilometers, so $\\text{K km}$^{-1}$, or equivalently $^\\circ\\text{C km}^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "lapse rate feedback\n",
    "  The {term}`radiative feedback` due to changes in the {term}`lapse rate` as the climate responds to a {term}`radiative forcing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Globally, the lapse rate feedback is a {term}`negative feedback`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Regionally, it is most negative in the Tropics due to the amplified warming aloft associated with the approximately moist adiabatic lapse rate there.  At higher latitudes, due to an inversion in temperature near the surface, the lapse rate feedback is a {term}`positive feedback`.\n",
    "\n",
    "longwave radiation\n",
    "  Essentially, the radiation emitted by the Earth.  This corresponds to electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths spanning approximately 5-80 {term}`micron`.  Commonly abbreviated to LW.  Units are Watts divided by square meter, $\\text{W m}^{-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To be contrasted with {term}`shortwave radiation`, which essentially is the radiation emitted by the sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "micron\n",
    "  Another name for a micrometer.  The micro prefix means one-millionth and is denoted with a greek mu: $\\mu$.  So one micron equals one millionth of a meter, or one thousandth of a millimeter: $1\\;\\mu\\text{ m}=10^{-6}\\text{ m}=10^{-3}\\text{ mm}$\n",
    "\n",
    "model uncertainty\n",
    "  From *Hawkins and Sutton 2007*, the uncertainty in future projections of some climate variable stemming from differences across climate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "moist static energy\n",
    "  A commonly used representation of the energy per unit mass of a moist air parcel in Earth's atmosphere.  Often abbreviated MSE.  It is the sum of three terms: $\\text{MSE}=c_pT+gz+L_vq$: \n",
    "  - $c_p$ is the specific heat of air at constant pressure, $T$ is temperature in Kelvin, and their product represents the parcel's *thermal energy*\n",
    "  - $g=9.81\\text{ m s}^{-2}$ is Earth's gravitational constant, $z$ is height in meters, and their product represents the parcel's *potential energy*\n",
    "  - $L_v=2.5\\times10^{6}\\text{ J kg}^{-1}$ is the latent heat of vaporization of water, $q$ is {term}`specific humidity` (dimensionless), and their product represents the heat that would be released if all of the parcel's water vapor condensed into liquid water\n",
    "\n",
    "negative feedback\n",
    "  For our purposes, a {term}`radiative feedback` that acts to *damp* an existing radiative *imbalance* at the {term}`top of atmosphere`.  A.k.a. a *stabilizing* feedback.  As such, negative feedbacks act to weaken suface warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For the global mean, the key negative feedbacks are the {term}`Planck feedback` and {term}`lapse rate feedback`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The global-mean net radiative feedback is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "outgoing longwave radiation\n",
    "  The upward flux of longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere, in units Watts divided by square meter, $\\text{W m}^{-2}$.  Commonly abbreviated to OLR.  *Outgoing* means that it is signed positive out of the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "planck feedback\n",
    "  The {term}`radiative feedback` stemming directly from the {term}`Stefan-Boltzmann law`: blackbody emission increases with temperature to the fourth power, and so all else equal if the surface temperature and rest of the troposphere warm up by some amount, the {term}`outgoing longwave radiation` will increase, acting to reduce the net imbalance at the {term}`top of atmosphere` that led to the initial warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Globally averaged, it is the single largest {term}`negative feedback`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Regionally, it contributes to {term}`polar amplification` because the increase in radiation per unit warming itself increases with the original temperature.  As such, warming in the Tropics where it's warm leads to a larger increase in emitted {term}`longwave radiation` compared to the same warming near the poles where it's much colder.\n",
    "\n",
    "polar amplification\n",
    "  The tendency for surface temperature increases in response to positive {term}`radiative forcing` such as increased CO$_2$ to be greater near the poles than at lower latitudes.  This is especially true for the Arctic, and so sometimes it's referred to as *Arctic amplification*.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  There are three key {term}`radiative feedback` processes that contribute to polar amplification, in each case due to that feedback being more stabilizing at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes: (1) Planck feedback, (2) surface albedo feedback, and (3) lapse rate feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "  For the Antarctic, the prevailing upwelling of cold water from depth in the Southern Ocean tends to delay the warming in the southern high latitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "positive feedback\n",
    "  For our purposes, a {term}`radiative feedback` that acts to *amplify* an existing radiative *imbalance* at the {term}`top of atmosphere`.  A.k.a. an *amplifying* feedback.  As such, positive feedbacks act to amplify suface warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For the global mean, the key positive feedbacks are the {term}`water vapor feedback` and {term}`surface albdo feedback`.  The {term}`cloud feedback` is most likely positive too, but it is subject to much more uncertainty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "radiative feedback\n",
    "  A process driven by the change in Earth's *surface* temperature that results in a change in the net {term}`top of atmosphere` radiative flux.  More formally, the change in Watts per meter squared at TOA per Kelvin change in surface temperature.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Any particular radiative feedback can be a {term}`positive feedback` or a {term}`negative feedback`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The key individual feedbacks for Earth's present-day climate are the {term}`Planck feedback`, {term}`water vapor feedback`, {term}`lapse rate feedback`, {term}`surface albedo feedback`, and {term}`cloud feedback`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The **net** radiative feedback is the sum of all these individual feedback processes.  The net global-mean feedback must be negative; otherwise the TOA radiative imbalance would only grow and grow, and a new equilibrium would never be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In addition to global-mean feedbacks, the feedbacks can be analyzed regionally, for example to help understand the causes of {term}`polar amplification`.\n",
    "\n",
    "radiative forcing\n",
    "  The net radiative imbalance at the {term}`top of atmosphere` immediately following some perturbation imposed externally on the climate system, before the climate system has had time to meaningfully adjust in order to reach a new equilibrium.  Units Watts per square meter and signed positive *downward*, i.e. positive if there's a net *surplus* of radiation entering the climate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For example, supposing that atmospheric CO$_$ was instantaneously doubled, the radiative forcing is approximately $4\\text{ W m}^{-2}$.  But it can be applied to other perturbations too, e.g. historical anthropogenic aerosol emissions, or changes in {term}`insolation` due to solar cycles or orbital variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (It's hard to directly measure, so we infer it from numerical models of radiative transfer and of other salient processes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  (Strictly speaking, there is a meaningful distinction between the TOA imbalance that arises *instantaneously* after the perturbation is applied and the TOA imbalance after say a few weeks, a time period that's long enough that the atmosphere adjusts to some extent but short enough that the more sluggish surface temperature hasn't changed much yet.  The TOA imbalance after this \"rapid adjustment\" is referred to as *effective radiative forcing* (ERF), and long-term warming is better predicted by the ERF than the *instantaneous* radiative forcing.  But we won't worry about that distinction in this course.)\n",
    "\n",
    "relative humidity\n",
    "  For our purposes, the {term}`specific humidity` divided by the {term}`saturation specific humidity`.  It is a dimensionless quantity.  It can range from zero if the air is completely dry up to 1, i.e. 100%, if the air is saturated.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Under climate change, it happens to be the case that the relative humidity within the troposphere doesn't change by a lot.  Combined with the rapid increase of {term}`saturation specific humidity` with warming due to the {term}`Clausius-Clapeyron` equation, \n",
    "\n",
    "  Relative humidity can also be above 100% in cases of *supersaturation*, which can occur if there aren't enough {term}`aerosol` particles in the air that can act as {term}`cloud condensation nuclei` that the water can condense onto, forming cloud droplets.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (More precisely, it is defined as the partial pressure of water vapor divided by the saturation partial pressure of water vapor.  But this ratio in terms of partial pressures is very closely approximated by the ratio in terms of specific humidities, and specific humidity is the more directly relevant quantity for things we care about such as radiative transfer and {term}`moist static energy`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`saturation`\n",
    "  The \n",
    "\n",
    "saturation specific humidity\n",
    "  Given an air parcel with a temperature $T$, the specific humidity value that air parcel would have if the parcel was at {term}`saturation`\n",
    "\n",
    "scattering\n",
    "  In radiative transfer, when a photon hits a molecule and is \"bounced\" to a different direction.  Unlike in {term}`absorption`, the photon continues to exist and has the same wavelength and hence energy as it did before encountering the molecule.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This doesn't have to be reflection straight back in the original direction; it can be a more modest change in angle.  But for our purposes what's really important here is when a {term}`shortwave radiation` photon traveling downward toward Earth's surface gets reflected back up, either by the surface or within the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "scenario uncertainty\n",
    "  From *Hawkins and Sutton 2007*, the uncertainty in future projections of some climate variable stemming from uncertainty in what will happen societally regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other anthropogenic influences on climate.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  It's possible that, for example, a political breakthrough and/or technological breakthrough cause emissions to go down rapidly.  It's also possible that, for example, political deadlock on carbon policy or unexpectedly rapid population growth cause emission to continue increasing for the rest of the century.  Or anything in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Unlike {term}`internal variability` and {term}`model uncertainty`, this is not a source of uncertainty that can be directly addressed via the physical climate science and climate models we are otherwise mostly learning about in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "shortwave radiation\n",
    "  Essentially, the radiation emitted by the Sun.  This corresponds to electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths spanning approximately 0.1-2 {term}`micron`.  Commonly abbreviated to SW.  Units are Watts divided by square meter, $\\text{W m}^{-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To be contrasted with {term}`longwave radiation`, which essentially is the radiation emitted by the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "specific humidity\n",
    "  For a given volume of air, the mass of water vapor divided by the total air mass.  Usually denoted $q$.  Dimensionless: kg / kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stefan-Boltzmann law\n",
    "  The equation for how much energy per unit area that a {term}`blackbody` emits, in units Watts per square meter: $E=\\sigma T^4$, where $T$ is the blackbody's temperature and $\\sigma=5.67^10^{-8}\\text{ W m}^{-2}\\text{ K}^{-1/4}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n",
    "\n",
    "steric sea level rise\n",
    "  The component of sea level rise that stems directly from changes in the seawater *density*.  Water expands as it warms, and so warming of the ocean induces a steric sea level rise directly even if there was no extra mass of water added: the same amount of water takes up more space, and so it has to go up.\n",
    "\n",
    "surface albedo feedback\n",
    "  In response to a positive {term}`radiative forcing` (such as increased CO$_2$), surface temperatures increase, causing some ice and snow will melt, which exposes darker ocean or land surface underneath and thus causes more {term}`shortwave radiation` to be absorbed.  This acts to increase the original positive radiative forcing and thus amplify the warming, compared to the hypothetical case if the surface albedo had remained unchanged.  It thus constitutes a {term}`positive feedback` in the global mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "  It promotes {term}`polar amplification` because the ice and snow occurs at high latitudes, so the extra shortwave absorption is concentrated in high latitudes promoting more rapid local warming compared to lower latitudes, all else equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "top of atmosphere\n",
    "  The top of the atmosphere.  Commonly abbreviated as TOA.  Important because it constitutes the outer boundary of the whole climate system.  So, for planetary energy balance, the net energy flux across the TOA must be exactly zero for Earth's climate to be in equilibrium.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  (In reality, there is no true, well-defined \"top\" of the atmosphere, with the atmosphere below and outer space above.  Instead, the atmosphere gradually thins moving higher and higher up.  But for practical purposes, it is completely kosher and useful to act as if there is one.)\n",
    "\n",
    "transmission\n",
    "  In radiative transfer, when a photon encounters a molecule but simply passes right through it unchanged, as if the molecule wasn't even there.  This is to be contrasted with {term}`absorption` and {term}`scattering`, which are the other two possible outcomes when a photon meets a molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (This is by far the most common outcome within Earth's atmosphere.  Generally $>95\\%$ of the atmosphere by mass consists of N$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules, which are almost completely inert and as such do not interact with either {term}`shortwave radiation` or {term}`longwave radiation`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "troposphere\n",
    "  the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere, extending from the surface vertically upwards to around 10-15 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "two-stream approximation\n",
    "  The commonly used simplification of the spectral dependence of radiative transfer for Earth's climate where all radiation from the sun arriving at Earth is considered {term}`shortwave radiation` (SW) and all radiation emitted by the Earth is considered {term}`longwave radiation` (LW).\n",
    "\n",
    "water vapor feedback\n",
    "  The {term}`radiative feedback` due to the increase of atmospheric water vapor with temperature, which is driven most fundamentally by the {term}`Clausius-Clapeyron` equation.  Because water vapor is a potent {term}`greenhouse gas`, the resulting increase in the {term}`absorption` of {term}`longwave radiation` acts to amplify the initial {emph}`radiative forcing` that led to the initial temperature change.  It is therefore a {term}`positive feedback`.\n",
