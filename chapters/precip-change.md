# Flux


# Mass flux
Recall that we use $\rho$ to denote {term}`density`, that we use $v$ to denote {term}`meridional` velocity, and that density is the mass of air divided by its volume.

How much mass of air does the atmosphere transport per unit time in the north-south direction at any given location and time?  

How about in total at each latitude, summing over all heights and longitudes?

Let's think through the units.  Mass has units kg, area has units m$^2$, and time has units $s$, so mass per unit area per time would be $\text{kg m}^{-2}\text{ s}^{-1}$

# Moisture flux
Recall that we use $q$ to denote {term}`specific humidity`, that we use $v$ to denote {term}`meridional` velocity, and that specific humidity is the mass of water vapor divided by the total mass of air in a given volume.

How much water vapor does the atmosphere transport in the north-south direction at any given location and time?  

How about in total at each latitude, summing over all heights and longitudes?



# Distinguishing beween *mean* vs. *extreme* precipitation

# Mean rainfall change
## "Rich get richer"

$$P-E\approx\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}_q$$

# Extreme rainfall change
