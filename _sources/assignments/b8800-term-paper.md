# Term project for B8800 section

:::{warning}
The term project is **only** for those students enrolled in the course as EAS B8800.  For those of you enrolled in EAS 48800 or SUS 7300B, this is **not** required.

## Overview: data analysis project on a climate dynamics topic of your choice
In a paper and accompanying in-class presentation focusing on some topic within the broad umbrella of climate science, you will access a dataset, perform some analyses on that dataset, read some relevant peer-reviewed articles, and synthesize your findings from your reading and your data analysis.
<!-- In a paper and accompanying in-class presentation, you will summarize the state of understanding of some topic within the broad umbrella of climate science, based on a close reading of at least ten published peer-reviewed scientific articles on that topic. -->

The topic needs to be (at least predominantly) **hard science** as opposed to, say, climate policy, climate justice, climate economics, etc.

<!-- Motivation: one of the single most important skills in science is the ability to effectively synthesize the contents of many technical articles into a coherent picture of what is understood and what remains open regarding the given topic.  (In fact, that's probably true of most *knowledge professions*, including law, medicine, and engineering as well.) 

A *literature review*, wherein you read widely on the topic and then synthesize your findings into your own written summary, is a great way to do that.  It forces you to read widely about the topic and, in developing your thoughts on that reading into written prose, organizing and tightening your understanding. -->

This should be about something that *you* particularly want to learn more about.  That said, for inspiration some example potential topics are:

- Polar-amplified warming
- Climate sensitivity vs. Earth-system sensitivity
- The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and climate
- How has the Montreal Protocol influenced global temperatures?
- How do aerosols influence deep convective clouds?
- Physically, how would Solar Radiation Management geoengineering work?
- Role of land-use and land-cover change in climate change
- Atmospheric circulations on other terrestrial planets
- How ocean biological processes are incorporated into climate models


## Expectations
### Length
The final submitted paper should be ~10-15 double-spaced pages, including figures and the bibliography.
<!-- The final submitted paper will be ~4000-5000 words, which should be ~10-15 double-spaced pages, including figures, but not including the bibliography. -->

The abstract should not exceed roughly 250 words.  The abstract should introduce the scientific question you're exploring, motivate it, and briefly summarize the paper's key findings, and possibly conclude with some outlook for future work etc.  No more, no less.

The 10-15 page range is only a guideline: more important than the exact length is how clearly you convey your scientific story.  If you can do that in, say, 8 pages, that's great.  (As the [adage](https://www.quora.com/Who-wrote-the-quote-If-I-had-more-time-I-would-have-written-you-a-shorter-letter) goes, "Sorry I wrote you a long [term paper]; I didn't have time to write you a shorter one.")

Or, especially if you include multiple large figures, perhaps you'll end up needing, say, 18 pages.

### Citations and bibliography
<!-- You must include in-line citations for *every* nontrivial factual claim made in your paper.  As such, at least in the main sections of your paper, nearly every sentence include a citation---and some sentences will include multiple, if either (1) multiple studies are relevant regarding the same point, or (2) the sentence brings up multiple, distinct nontrivial factual claims.  Even if multiple consecutive sentences are derived from the same single source, that source should be cited in each individual sentence, not just the last one. -->
You must include in-line citations for *every* nontrivial factual claim made in your paper that isn't based on your own data analysis.  Even if multiple consecutive sentences are derived from the same single source, that source should be cited in each individual sentence, not just the last one.

What is a "nontrivial factual claim?"  A useful rule of thumb is the following: would a typical adult be able to find the information *and understand it* via a few minutes of Googling?  If yes, it doesn't need a citation.  So, for example, the radius of Earth does not require a citation.  But if not, it does require a citation.  So, for example, the role Earth's radius plays in the atmospheric angular momentum distribution would require one or more citations.  

When in doubt, include a citation---much better to add a citation that could have been done without than to leave out a citation that really should have been there.  This is because omitting needed citations can give the impression of academic disintegrity, which is very serious indeed.  By comparison, excess citations are just moderately distracting/grating for the reader.

You must include a bibliography after the main text, comprising *every* paper that is cited in the main text *and no others*.

There is no particular required formatting style---MLM, APA, etc.---for the in-line citations or bibliography.  Pick one, use it consistently, and follow the same two rules:

- The bibliography entries must be *complete*, meaning they include each of the following: article title, publication, volume, issue, page numbers, DOI, and publication year or date.  E.g. "Jane Doe, "Numerical investigation of XYZ."  *Journal of ABC*, Volume 32, Issue 1, 1023-1033.  doi:10.1077/jabc-123." 
- The in-line citations should include the last name(s) of the author(s) and the year of publication, e.g. "Doe 2019", "Lopez and Doe 1994", or, if there are more than two authors, ``Lopez et al 1959''.

The bibliography entries of the final submitted paper should not include the annotations you generated earlier on in the semester.

### Figures and tables
In addition to the figures you generate yourself, you are welcome to include figures or tables taken from the papers you cite.  Simply include in the figure caption language along the lines of "Reproduction of Fig.~X from Martinez et al. 2020."  Likewise for tables.

Every included figure or table should be numbered, captioned, and explicitly referenced in the text at least once, even if the reference is as brief as “...blah blah (Figure 1)”.


### Formatting
In addition to being double-spaced, keep all other formatting (font, margins, etc.) standard-ish.  I'd rather have it go to e.g. a 16th page with ample margins and a 11 or 12-pt font rather than it being squished into 15 pages.

<!-- While the submitted rough draft can be, well, rough, the final submitted paper should be, well, final.  Among other things, that means it should be free of typos, grammatical errors, and other errors of English usage. -->

### Precision and concreteness
As much as possible, avoid generic statements like "X influences Y", where "influence" could alternatively be "effects", "modifies" "changes" etc.  Precisely how does X influence Y?  In what sign, and if possible quantitatively by how much?  Via what physical (or other) mechanism?

A useful rule of thumb here is: what/when/where/why/how/how much.  Each one should be answered.

### Avoid puff
"Puff" is a [phrase I'm borrowing](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9873666-utilize-a-noxious-puff-word-since-it-does-nothing-that-good-old) from the late author David Foster Wallace.  It denotes words, clauses, or sometimes whole sentences that are intended to make the writing seem more important than it actually is.  From DFW himself, describing one particular puff word, *utilize* (emphasis mine):

```{epigraph}
Utilize: A noxious puff-word.  Since it does nothing that good old *use* doesn’t do, its extra letters and syllables don’t make a writer seem smarter; rather, using utilize makes you seem either like a pompous twit or like someone so insecure that she’ll use pointlessly big words in an attempt to look sophisticated. [...] What’s worth remembering about puff-words is something that good writing teachers spend a lot of time drumming into undergrads: **“formal writing” does not mean gratuitously fancy writing; it means clean, clear, maximally considerate writing.**
```

Warning: LLMs such as ChatGPT tend to generate *tons* of puff.

### Editorializing
It's ok and even encoraged to give, as part of your Concluding section, some brief and narrowly scoped remarks regarding what you believe is important moving forward given what you learned from the papers you reviewed.  But keep it to that, and avoid absolutist language: (e.g. "we must", "imperative", etc.).  The job of this paper is to present some nontrivial data analysis on a given topic and put it in context of the broader state of understanding.  Nothing more, nothing less.

## Logistics
### How to submit
My preference is for you to submit the final paper and intermediate steps as [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) files, shared with me via [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

That said, I will also accept Word, Pages, or PDF files.  You can email them as attachments or share them with me via Google Drive...just use the Google Drive associated with your CUNY "citymail" email account, and share it with my email address that's on the syllabus.

### Timeline
<!-- - By **Friday, February 16th, 2024**: submit topic proposal (title and 1-2 sentence summary) -->
<!-- - By **Friday, May 2nd, 2025**: having read your 5 approved papers, submit draft title, abstract, and 5 additional papers.
- By **Friday, May 9th, 2025**: submit complete (but rough) draft. -->
- (early in the semester): Discuss and agree on a suitable topic w/ the Prof.
- By **Friday, April 25th**: Submit one plot or other form of data analysis on the dataset you've identified.  (This can be extremely simple...the point is mostly to ensure you've found a dataset and have successfully managed to access it and at least begin working with it.)
- By **Friday, May 2nd**: Submit draft title and annotated list of 3 papers you will read and incorporate into your own paper.  Annotations = 1-2 sentences explaining why you've chosen the paper.
- By **Friday, May 9th**: Submit draft versions of paper abstract and at least 5 figure panels or tables (that you generated), each one with a caption that fully describes it.
- **Wednesday, May 14th**: in-class final presentations
- **Sunday, May 18th** (by 11:59pm): Final paper submission deadline

### On incorporating feedback
For the instructor, it can be rather dismaying when the feedback you provide on a paper draft goes unheeded.  That said, not every suggestion an instructor provides will ultimately be the right choice.  So, please, make an earnest attempt to review, understand, and ultimately evaluated the feedback you receive.  For those suggestions you agree with or are at least not adamantly opposed to, implement them.  For those suggestions you disagree with, do not implement them, but let the instructor that you've made that decision, and why. -->
