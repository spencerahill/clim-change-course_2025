# Using the course JupyterHub

**LINK TO THE JUPYTERHUB: https://ccny25s-1.ees220002.projects.jetstream-cloud.org**

## Overview

We will use the Python programming language running within Jupyter notebooks to perform quantitative analyses of some climate datasets, run simple models, and other tasks.  If you aren't familiar with these, or even programming at all, that's ok, there is no programming prerequisite.  Jupyter notebooks are a way to work with code that makes it easy enough for novices to follow along too.

Any code ultimately has to have some computer to run on.  In principle, that could be your own computer, provided you downloaded and properly installed python, jupyter, and all the other requirements (which isn't as hard as it sounds, at least if you're not on Windows, but I digress).  

Rather than having each of you do all that installation and setup and forcing you to bring your laptop to every class, we will run these notebooks on a cloud-based server, called a JupyterHub, setup specifically for this class.

## Accessing the JupyterHub 

### Create a free Github account if you don't already have one

To make sure only students in the course can access the JupyterHub, you'll have to login using a Github account.  If you don't alreaady have one, they are free and take only a few minutes to setup: go [here](https://github.com/signup).

### Submit your Github profile name via Brightspace

There is an assignment within the course Brightspace where you submit your Github profile name.  Once you've done that, the professor will be able to add you as one of the approved users of the JupyterHub.

### Login to the JupyterHub.

The link to the course JupyterHub is at the top of this page and repeated [here](https://ccny25s-1.ees220002.projects.jetstream-cloud.org).  Once you've been added as an approved user, go there and login using your Github profile.  

You'll get a warning message about "Authorize JupyterHub CCNY Spring 2025 by Ana Espinoza."  Ana Espinoza is the sysadmin who is running the JupyterHub for us (thanks Ana!).  So go ahead and accept that.  Then, you should be able to login and end up at the Jupyterlab.

## Credits

This JupyterHub was setup and is being administered for us as a free service from Unidata.  The actual physical computer it lives on is at the University of Indiana.  Thank you Unidata, and go Hoosiers!
